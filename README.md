## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm a **frontend developer** currently transitioning into **full-stack development**, with a hunger for building apps that solve real problems and create value.

- 💡 I learn by doing — consistently shipping projects and features.
- 🌍 Passionate about working with **startups** that move fast and think big.
- 🛠️ Obsessed with clean UI, performant code, and meaningful user experiences.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🔨 Building **production-grade full-stack apps** with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Context API**
- 🛒 Just launched: [**ShopMart**](https://shop-mart-main.vercel.app) – a fully functional e-commerce platform built with React
- 🧠 Sharpening my skills in **JavaScript**, **API Integration**, **Git**, and **Deployment**
- 📈 Day 57 of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.instagram.com/i.am_kwarteng/) challenge — pushing my limits daily
